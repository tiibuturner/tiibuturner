Welcome to my GitHub- profile.👋
I am studying Business Information Technolog at Hämeen ammattikorkeakoulu (HAMK). 💻
I am on my second year and I plan to graduate in May 2025.

Passionate about cloud computing and everything that links to that. ☁️
Very fond of RobotFramework. 🤖

👉 I am currently working on a pile of homeworks, but also my own projects.

👉 At school, I am currently learning about analytics and the ways to do it. 

👉 On my spare time, I am studying about DevOps and containerization. 🤓

👈 You can find my LinkedIn- profile in there!

FUN FACT:
I LOVE Star Wars! I saw The Phantom Menace when I was 7 years old and it was love at first sight (despite of Jar Jar Binks).
